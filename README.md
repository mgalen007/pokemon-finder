**POKEMON FINDER**

Pokémon-Finder is a simple web application built using Python's Flask. It interacts with the popular PokeAPI to retrieve Pokémon data, then embeds it on the front end interactively.

**Steps to use it:**
1. In the command prompt, type: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2. Clone the code using: git clone https://github.com/mgalen007/pokemon-finder/
3. Navigate to the folder containing pokemon.py
4. Start the local Flask web server.
5. Paste the returned link in your browser and interact with it.
